Hopefully good reasons and not just like identity theft or doxing reasons. The point of this site is so that I can link to things that I have written and so that anyone who becomes aware that I exist and wants to know &amp;ldquo;what is the deal with this Paul that I&amp;rsquo;ve just come across&amp;rdquo; can reasonably answer that question.</description></item><item><title>Other writing</title><link>https://paul-brenner.github.io/posts/other-writing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 14:21:49 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://paul-brenner.github.io/posts/other-writing/</guid><description>Other posts I&amp;rsquo;ve written Here are a few links to content I&amp;rsquo;ve written and published elsewhere. Maybe someday I&amp;rsquo;ll self host these posts so that they aren&amp;rsquo;t at risk of disappearing? But maybe they are happy where they are.
